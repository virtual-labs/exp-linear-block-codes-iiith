# Theory 

The theory associated with Experiment-1 is divided into two parts:

(1) Preliminaries

(2) Linear block codes

## 1. Preliminaries

This section will introduce some preliminaries about finite fields,
binary arithmetic, and vector spaces that are relevant to Experiment-1.
For a detailed discussion of the topics, please refer [1, Ch. 2] and
[2, Ch. 1]. We shall discuss the following topics:

-   Introduction to finite fields and binary arithmetic.

-   Vector space spanned by the given set of vectors.

## 1.1 Introduction to finite fields and binary arithmetic


For all the experiments considered in this virtual lab, we consider
vectors and matrices that are defined over a finite field. In order to
define a finite field, we need to first define a "binary operation",
which is provided next.

**Definition 1** *(Binary operation): Let* \mathbb{F} *be a set of elements.
