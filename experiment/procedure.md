## Procedure

### Part-1: Preliminaries
There are two tasks in the **Preliminaries** section.
<br>
<br>

**Procedure for Linear-Independence:**
* The objective of this task is to find whether the given vectors are linearly independent or not.
* There are three examples. Attempt all of them. 
* In each example, enter the values of $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \in \\{0, 1\\}$ in the corresponding fields.
* Determine whether the vectors are linearly independent or not by choosing one of the options from the drop-down and click on **Submit**.
* The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in **Observations**.
* **Next** - Displays the next example.
* **Previous** - Displays the previous example.

**Procedure for Vector Space:**
* The objective of this task is to find the vector space spanned by the given vectors.
* There are three examples. Attempt all of them. 
* There are 16 vectors in the first box. To select a vector, click on it. It appears	in the second box.
* To deselect a vector from the second box, click on it. It appears back in the first	box.
* After selecting the required vectors, click on **Submit**.
* The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in **Observations**.

### Part-2: Linear Block Codes
There are five tasks in the **Linear Block Codes** section.
<br>
<br>
**Procedure for Block Codes:**
* The objective of this task is to find the parameters of the given block codes.
* There are four examples. Attempt all of them.
* Enter the values of the parameters in the given fields and click on **Submit**.
* The rate should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
* The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in **Observations**.
* **Next** - Displays the next example.
* **Previous** - Displays the previous example.

**Procedure for Encoding-REP:**
* The objective of this task is to understand the encoding procedure of a repetition code.
* First enter a binary message and click on **Submit**.
* The entered message will be displayed in **Observations**.
* Encode the message using an REP-3 Code and click on **Submit**.
* The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in **Observations**.
* If the answer is correct, click on **Reset** to try these steps again with a different binary message. 
---
**Procedure for Encoding-SPC:**
* The objective of this task is to understand the encoding procedure of a single parity check code.
* First enter a binary message and click on **Submit**.
* The entered message will be displayed in **Observations**.
* Encode the message using a (3, 2) Single Parity Check Code and click on **Submit**.
* The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in **Observations**.
* If the answer is correct, click on **Reset** to try these steps again with a different binary message. 
---
**Procedure for Majority Logic Decoding:**
* The objective of this task is to find the decoded message by performing majority logic decoding on a received bitstream.
*   Enter the decoded message and click on **Submit**.
*   The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in **Observations**.
*   **Refresh** - Generates another bitstream.
---
**Procedure for Error Detection:**
* The objective of this task is to detect whether a received codeword has an error or not.
* Choose an option from the drop-down and click on **Submit**.
* The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in **Observations**.
*  **Refresh** - Generates another codeword.
